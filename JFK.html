				<p id="Text">John Fitzgerald Kennedy, often referred to by his initials JFK, served as the 35th president of the United States from 1961 until his assassination in 1963. Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his work as president concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. He is known for being a very good speaker, and he motivated the American people to put a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. His famous saying is "not because they are easy, but because they are hard."</p>
